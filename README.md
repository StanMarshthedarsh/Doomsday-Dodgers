Don't Kill Kenny

A South Park Fangame by Shaun Kho.

INTRO:

Don't Kill Kenny is a game that... well the title says it all: You play as Kenny and attempt to dodge 5 different kinds of obstacles that will try to kill you. There are also 5 unique powerups to aid you in getting that brand new high score. 

CONTROLS:

Use the left and right arrow keys to move Kenny around and space to jump. You can also press p to pause the game.

COMPLEXITY:

Don't Kill Kenny contains 4 game modes, 4 game states, 5 different enemies, and 5 different powerups that all move and behave differently. Some enemies move faster and are thus harder to dodge like meteors. Powerups have varying effects such as slowing the game down, doubling the rate of score gain, and allowing the player to jump way higher. There is also a powerup that's like the star powerup in Super Mario Bros, which allows Kenny to turn invinsible and destroy all enemies on contact. Due to the varying effects and behaviors of enemies and powerups, I can say that my game is of reasonable complexity.

SURPRISES:

Keep an eye out because there's a surprise hidden in the game :) You won't know if you never try searching for it. I'm gonna give you a hint: Pressing a certain key on the far right will unleash it. Look it up on the internet and you'll find that it's something really (in)famous...  And, in case you fell for it, you can press q to take you back to where you were before.

Hope you enjoy the game!
