Doomsday Dodgers
by Shaun Kho

INTRO:

Kenneth wakes up and the next thing he knows his house is set ablaze by a meteor. Help him survive as long as possible as he races through an endless street.

CONTROLS:

Use the left and right arrow keys to move Kenneth around and space to jump. You can also press p to pause the game.

COMPLEXITY:

Doomsday Dodgers contains 4 game modes, 4 game states, 5 different enemies, and 5 different powerups that all move and behave differently. Some enemies move faster and are thus harder to dodge like meteors. Powerups have varying effects such as slowing the game down, doubling the rate of score gain, and allowing the player to jump way higher. There is also a powerup that's like the star powerup in Super Mario Bros, which allows Kenneth to turn invinsible and destroy all enemies on contact. 

SURPRISES:

Keep an eye out because there's a surprise hidden in the game :) You won't know if you never try searching for it. I'm gonna give you a hint: Pressing a certain key on the far right will unleash it. Look it up on the internet and you'll find that it's something really (in)famous...  And, in case you fell for it, you can press q to take you back to where you were before.

Hope you enjoy the game!
